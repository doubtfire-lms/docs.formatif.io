These staff can easily be added to the unit by searching for\nthe staff member's name, and then selecting the _Add Staff_ button.\n\n**Note:** The search field will autocomplete the staff members name, if the staff member you are trying to assign to a\nunit is not appearing, ensure the name is spelled correctly, and that the user has previously added to the Doubtfire\nsystem. See the enrolling users guide for more details.\n\n![Staff](/guides/create-manage-units/staff.png)\n\n# Tutorials\n\nSelect the fourth tab: _Tutorials_\n\nTutorials include the physical and cloud/online tutorials for a unit for which students will attend. Each tutorial will\nhave a tutor from the teaching staff for the unit assigned.\n\n![Tutorials](/guides/create-manage-units/tutorials.png)\n\nTo create a new tutorial, simply select the _Add Tutorial_ button, and fill in the fields in the modal. This includes:\n\n- **Abbreviation** - A short abbreviation for the unit, example: LA1.\n- **Location** - The room code for the tutorial. If the tutorial does not have a room, you can chose the text, for\n  example \"cloud1\"\n- **Day** - The day of the tutorial.\n- **Time** - The time of the tutorial.\n- **Tutor** - The staff member who will be taking the tutorial. This is the tutor who will receive the student\n  submissions for the unit.\n\nAfter completing the modal, simply select _Create Unit_ to create the unit.\n\n# Students\n\n\"Students\" is the list of students who are enrolled into the unit. You can enroll students by batch, or manually. See\nthe \"Enroll and Manage Units\" guide for more information on how to enroll and manage students.\n\n# Tasks\n\nThe tasks are the individual learning tasks which your students will complete in a unit. See the \"Creating and Managing\nTasks\" guide for more information.\n\n# Task Alignment\n\nTask Alignment is the relationship between a task, and each of the learning outcomes which were entered in a previous\nstep. You should align each task to demonstrate how strongly it relates to a learning outcome.\n\nFor example, in this screenshot, task 1.1P Strongly aligns with the _CT_ learning outcome (Critical Thinking), but only\nweakly (2/5) aligns with the _W_ (Writing) learning outcome. You can present a rationale for each alignment.\n\n![Task Alignment](/guides/create-manage-units/task-alignment.png)\n\n# Groups\n\nSee the [Student Management guide](/guides/enrol-manage-students) for information on creating and managing student\ngroups in Doubtfire.\n","title":"Creating & managing units","summary":"See how you can create & manage units in Doubtfire","authors":["jakerenzella"],"html":"<p>To get started with creating and managing a unit in Doubtfire, ensure your account is of the correct permission level, and log in to Doubtfire.</p><ol><li><p>After logging in to Doubtfire, select <em>Administration</em> -> <em>Manage Units</em> from the menu on the top right menu.</p><p><img src=\"/guides/create-manage-units/manage-units.png\" alt=\"Manage Units\"></p></li><li><p>Select <em>create unit</em></p><p><img src=\"/guides/create-manage-units/create-unit.png\" alt=\"Manage Units\"></p></li><li><p>Enter the name and unit code of the unit:</p><p><img src=\"/guides/create-manage-units/enter-name.png\" alt=\"Manage Units\"></p></li><li><p>After the unit is created, select the newly created unit from the list of units:</p><p><img src=\"/guides/create-manage-units/select-created-unit.png\" alt=\"Manage Units\"></p></li></ol><p>Now that the unit is created, there are a number of settings which must be populate before the unit can be properly used:</p><h2 id=\"general-unit-details\">General Unit Details<a href=\"#general-unit-details\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span> §</span></a></h2><p><em>Select the first tab: <em>unit details</em>.</em></p><p>Enter all details:</p><ul><li>Unit Code</li><li>Unit Name</li><li>Unit Description</li><li>Start Date</li><li>End Date</li><li>Active (Whether the unit is open)</li></ul><p><img src=\"/guides/create-manage-units/unit-details.png\" alt=\"Manage Units\"></p><h2 id=\"learning-outcomes\">Learning Outcomes<a href=\"#learning-outcomes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span> §</span></a></h2><p>Select the second tab: <em>Learning Outcomes</em></p><p>Add or delete learning outcomes for the unit by filling the fields in the <em>Add Outcome</em> modal.</p><p><img src=\"/guides/create-manage-units/learning-outcomes.png\" alt=\"Manage Units\"></p><p>Learning Outcomes can also be batch uploaded or downloaded, by using a CSV file in the right-hand-side upload/download panel.</p><h2 id=\"staff\">Staff<a href=\"#staff\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span> §</span></a></h2><p>Select the third tab: <em>staff</em></p><p>The staff for a unit include the unit chair, and tutors.
