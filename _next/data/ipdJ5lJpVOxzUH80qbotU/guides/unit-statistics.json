{"pageProps":{"id":"unit-statistics","audience":"staff","markdown":"\nThere are a number of different statistics available within the Doubtfire LMS, which can be viewed at any time during a\nunit by the teaching staff. In this article, we will explore how to view and interpret the different types of\nstatistics.\n\nTo view all unit statistics, from the _Administration_ menu, select _manage units_ and select the appropriate unit.\n\n![Select Unit](/guides/unit-statistics/manage-units.png)\n\nFrom the top-left menu, select _Unit Analytics_:\n\n![Unit Analytics](/guides/unit-statistics/unit-analytics.png)\n\nYou will now be presented with the unit analytics page.\n\n# Unit Statistics\n\nThe first tab provides two CSV download options:\n\n- Task Completion Statistics - A breakdown of each student's progress through the unit tasks.\n\n- Tutor Assessment Statistics - A breakdown of the number of tasks assessed by each tutor in the unit _(useful for\n  calculating marking pay)_\n\n![Unit Statistics](/guides/unit-statistics/unit-statistics.png)\n\n# Task Status Statistics\n\nTask Status Statistics provides a breakdown of each task's status. For example in the image below, ~28% of the unit's\ntasks are complete.\n\n![Task Status](/guides/unit-statistics/task-status.png)\n\nMost of the statistics can be broken down into 3 categories noted by the three-switch at the top-right.\n\n1. **Building Icon** - indicates the shown statistics are throughout the whole unit.\n\n1. **Pencil Icon** - indicates the shown statistics are throughout an individual tutorial.\n\n   ![tutorial stats](/guides/unit-statistics/switch-view.png)\n\n1. **Chart Icon** - indicates the shown statistics are broken down by task.\n\n   ![Task Stats](/guides/unit-statistics/switch-view-2.png)\n\n**Note:** These categories apply to multiple statistics views.\n\n# Task Completion Statistics.\n\nShows the distribution of tasks completed in a unit. In the below example, this can be interpreted as out of the 10\ntasks in the unit (Y axis), students have completed 3.5 on average.\n\n![task completion stats](/guides/unit-statistics/task-completion.png)\n\n# Target Grade Statistics.\n\nShows a breakdown of target grades chosen by students:\n\n![Target Grade Statistics](/guides/unit-statistics/target-grade.png)\n\n# Task Statistics\n\nThe task statistics page simply shows every student's progress in each of the tasks. Each bubble represents a tutorial,\nand the size of the bubble represents the amount of students in the tutorial. The placement of the tutorial across the X\naxis shows which state the task is in. In the example below, most of the tasks are in the \"not started\" state:\n\n![task stats](/guides/unit-statistics/task-statistics.png)\n","title":"Unit Statistics","summary":"See how you can view and analyse unit statistics.","authors":["jakerenzella"],"html":"<p>There are a number of different statistics available within the Doubtfire LMS, which can be viewed at any time during a unit by the teaching staff.
