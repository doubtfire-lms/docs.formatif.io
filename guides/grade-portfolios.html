Switch to the **Student Portfolios** section in the staff view to start assessing student portfolios. This page\n   should contains all of the necessary details to perform the assessments.\n\n1. The **Select Student** tab is focused on selecting the student. The body of the page contains a list of students,\n   their target grades, task status, and awarded numeric grade.\n\n1. You filter the student list with a **search** term that looks at student identifiers, names, and tutor names.\n\n1. Buttons on the right of the table header allow you to filter the student list. The first filter allows you to switch\n   between **all student** and **students with a portfolio**. By default only students with a portfolio will be listed\n   in the table.
