To manage students in a group, first you need to ensure your unit has group sets setup. A group set is a definition of
the types of groups you can have in a unit. To setup a group set:

1. Log in to Doubtfire

1. Select Manage Units from the Administration dropdown:

   <!-- TODO: <img alt="Manage Units" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/manage-units.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

1. Select the unit you wish to adminster

1. Select the _group_ tab:
   <!-- TODO: <img alt="Manage Groups" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/group-set.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

1. Select _New Group Set_

   You will now see a new group created in the Group Set list, select the edit button to edit the following options:

   - Name - The name of the group set, by default this is "Group Work"
   - Create Groups - Who has permissions to create new groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.
   - Manage Groups - Who has permissions to manage groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.
   - Restrict to Tutorials - if true, only students from the same tutorial can be in a group.

1. Select _save_ then select the group set in the group sets list to view more information:

   - Create a group of students in the group set, by typing a group name, and selecting _Create Group_:

   <!-- TODO: <img alt="Create Group" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/new-group.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

   - Add students to the group by typing the student name:

   <!-- TODO: <img alt="Adding Students to Group" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/adding-members.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

   You can also export and import CSV files for batch group allocation. To view the correct format of the CSV file for
   import, you can export the CSV by selecting _Download CSV_.
