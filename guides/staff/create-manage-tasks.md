we can create and manage tasks.

1. Log in to Formatif

1. Select Manage Units from the Administration dropdown:

1. Select the unit you wish to administer

1. Select the _tasks_ tab:

   ![Tasks Tab](/guides/create-manage-tasks/tasks.png)

   You will now see a list of tasks, or an empty panel if no tasks have been created in the unit.

# Creating a task

In Formatif, there is no difference in how you create and edit a task. Let's take a look at how to create a new task.

1. Select the green _Add Task_ button in the Task List panel.

1. Underneath the Task List panel, you will see the _Create Task_ panel, with the following tabs on the left hand side
   (from top to bottom):

   - **Task Description**: The general information of the task.

   - **Submission Details**: The submission requirements students will need to meet in for the task to become complete.

   - **Task Resources**: The task sheet or other resources used to help students complete the task.

   - **Plagiarism Detection**: If enabled, the percentage similarity where Formatif creates a warning.

# Batch upload or export of tasks

In Formatif, you can batch import or export task definitions from the same tasks page. To do this, stay on the _tasks_
panel, and on the right hand side you will find:

- Batch Upload Task Definitions
- Download Tasks
- Upload All Tasks
