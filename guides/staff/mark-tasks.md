Marking student submissions in Doubtfire is done throughout the "Task Inbox" page. The Task Inbox is the default view
after logging in to Doubtfire, and selecting a unit.

1. Log in to Doubtfire and select the unit from the "Units You Teach" list:

<!-- TODO: <img alt="Select Unit" src="/images/articles/staff/mark-submissions/select-unit.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

1. The task inbox is divided into 3 panels:

1. Task List, the left panel
1. The Submission, the center panel
1. The Comments, the right panel.

1. To mark a submission, select the task from the task list, and view the submission in the center panel. There are a
   number of possible states you can place the task on, which are located on the bottom of the submission panel. In
   sequence of appearance these include:

- Fail
- Mark As Feedback Exceeded
- Redo
- Fix and Resubmit
- Discuss
- Demonstrate
- Complete

A description of each of these states can be read by hovering your mouse over the state:

<!-- TODO: <img alt="View State Details" src="/images/articles/staff/mark-submissions/view-state-details.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

4. Select the desired state for the submission, and the state will instantly be updated:

<!-- TODO: <img alt="State changed" src="/images/articles/students/change-target-grade/task-marked-updated.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

5. Leave a comment At any time during this process, you can leave a written, audio or image comment on the task. These
   comments are specific to each individual task between the teaching staff and the student. To leave an audio comment,
   simply click the _microphone_ icon, and click "record". Ensure you are using a modern browser if audio comments are
   not working. Image comments can be uploaded by dragging the image into the comment field, and clicking send.
