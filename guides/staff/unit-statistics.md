There are a number of different statistics available within the Doubtfire LMS, which can be viewed at any time during a
unit by the teaching staff. In this article, we will explore how to view and interpret the different types of
statistics.

To view all unit statistics, from the _Administration_ menu, select _manage units_ and select the appropriate unit.

<!-- TODO: <img alt="Select Unit" src="/images/articles/staff/unit-analytics/manage-units.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

From the top-left menu, select \*Unit Analytics:

<!-- TODO: <img alt="Unit Analytics" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/unit-analytics.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

You will now be presented with the unit analytics page.

# Unit Statistics

The first tab provides two CSV download options:

- Task Completion Statistics - A breakdown of each student's progress through the unit tasks.
- Tutor Assessment Statistics - A breakdown of the number of tasks assessed by each tutor in the unit _(useful for
  calculating marking pay)_

# Task Status Statistics

Task Status Statistics provides a breakdown of each task's status. For example in the image below, ~28% of the unit's
tasks are complete.

<!-- TODO: <img alt="Task Status" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/task-status.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

Most of the statistics can be broken down into 3 categories noted by the three-switch at the top-right.

1. Building Icon - indicates the shown statistics are throughout the whole unit.

2. Pencil Icon - indicates the shown statistics are throughout an individual tutorial.

   <!-- TODO: <img alt="tutorial stats" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/switch-view.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

3. Chart Icon - indicates the shown statistics are broken down by task.

  <!-- TODO: <img alt="Task Stats" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/switch-view-2.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

_Note:_ These categories apply to multiple statistics views.

# Task Completion Statistics.

Shows the distribution of tasks completed in a unit. In the below example, this can be interpreted as out of the 10
tasks in the unit (Y axis), students have completed 3.5 on average.

<!-- TODO: <img alt="task completion stats" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/task-completion.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

# Target Grade Statistics.

Shows a breakdown of target grades chosen by students:

<!-- TODO: <img alt="Target Grade Statistics" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/target-grade.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

# Task Statistics

The task statistics page simply shows every student's progress in each of the tasks. Each bubble represents a tutorial,
and the size of the bubble represents the amount of students in the tutorial. The placement of the tutorial across the X
axis shows which state the task is in. In the example below, most of the tasks are in the "not started" state:
