There are a number of different statistics available within the Doubtfire LMS, which can be viewed at any time during a
unit by the teaching staff. In this article, we will explore how to view and interpret the different types of
statistics.

To view all unit statistics, from the _Administration_ menu, select _manage units_ and select the appropriate unit.

From the top-left menu, select _Unit Analytics_:

You will now be presented with the unit analytics page.

# Unit Statistics

The first tab provides two CSV download options:

- Task Completion Statistics - A breakdown of each student's progress through the unit tasks.

- Tutor Assessment Statistics - A breakdown of the number of tasks assessed by each tutor in the unit _(useful for
  calculating marking pay)_

# Task Status Statistics

Task Status Statistics provides a breakdown of each task's status. For example in the image below, ~28% of the unit's
tasks are complete.

Most of the statistics can be broken down into 3 categories noted by the three-switch at the top-right.

1. Building Icon - indicates the shown statistics are throughout the whole unit.

1. Pencil Icon - indicates the shown statistics are throughout an individual tutorial.

1. Chart Icon - indicates the shown statistics are broken down by task.

**Note:** These categories apply to multiple statistics views.

# Task Completion Statistics.

Shows the distribution of tasks completed in a unit. In the below example, this can be interpreted as out of the 10
tasks in the unit (Y axis), students have completed 3.5 on average.

# Target Grade Statistics.

Shows a breakdown of target grades chosen by students:

# Task Statistics

The task statistics page simply shows every student's progress in each of the tasks. Each bubble represents a tutorial,
and the size of the bubble represents the amount of students in the tutorial. The placement of the tutorial across the X
axis shows which state the task is in. In the example below, most of the tasks are in the "not started" state:
