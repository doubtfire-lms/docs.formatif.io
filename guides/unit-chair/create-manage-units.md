# Staff

The staff for a unit include the unit chair, and tutors. These staff can easily be added to the unit by searching for
the staff member's name, and then selecting the _Add Staff_ button.

_Note:_ The search field will autocompelte the staff members name, if the staff member you are trying to assign to a
unit is not appearing, ensure the name is spelled correctly, and that the user has previously added to the Doubtfire
system. See the enrolling users guide for more details.

# Tutorials

Select the fourth tab: _Tutorials_

Tutorials include the physical and cloud/online tutorials for a unit for which students will attend. Each tutorial will
have a tutor from the teaching staff for the unit assigned.

<!-- TODO: <img alt="Tutorials" src="/images/articles/staff/create-manage-units/tutorials.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img> -->

To create a new tutorial, simply select the _Add Tutorial_ button, and fill in the fields in the modal. This includes:

- **Abbreviation** - A short abbreviation for the unit, example: LA1.
- **Location** - The room code for the tutorial. If the tutorial does not have a room, you can chose the text, for
  example "cloud1"
- **Day** - The day of the tutorial.
- **Time** - The time of the tutorial.
- **Tutor** - The staff member who will be taking the tutorial. This is the tutor who will receive the student
  submissions for the unit.

After completing the modal, simply select _Create Unit_ to create the unit.

# Students

"Students" is the list of students who are enrolled into the unit. You can enroll students by batch, or manually. See
the "Enroll and Manage Units" guide for more information on how to enroll and manage students.

# Tasks

The tasks are the individual learning tasks which your students will complete in a unit. See the "Creating and Managing
Tasks" guide for more information.

# Task Alignment

Task Alignment is the relationship between a task, and each of the learning outcomes which were entered in a previous
step. You should align each task to demonstrate how strongly it relates to a learning outcome.

For example, in this screenshot, task 1.1P Strongly aligns with the _CT_ learning outcome (Critical Thinking), but only
weakly (2/5) aligns with the _W_ (Writing) learning outcome. You can present a rationale for each alignment.

# Groups

See the "Student Management" guide for information on creating and managing student groups in Doubtfire.
